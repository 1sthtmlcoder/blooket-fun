# Unblock Guide

This guide will teach you the ways to get the Blooket Utility running on a computer or network that restricts access to the Blooket Utility. Please note that there exists no 100% reliable method to unblock the Blooket Utility.

## The iframe method

This method has the highest probability to work if you are being blocked by the computer. This could be something like a forced installed extension on a web browser with the intention to block sites. Simply navigate to https://thatfrueddued.github.io/unblock.html. If successful, you should be able to use the site like normal.

## The DNS method

This method is useful if the network you are on is blocking the Blooket Utility. First, you have to figure out how to set custom DNS servers on your device. Try looking up "set custom dns servers on a chromebook" or "set custom dns servers on a windows 10" for your specific device. Then, change the primary or first DNS server to "1.1.1.1" and if a secondary option is available, set it to "1.0.0.1" (both without quotes). Then, save these settings. Try accessing the Blooket Utility by going to https://blooket-utility.okr765.com. If you get an error message from your browser about your connection, this means the method failed.

## The VPN method

Note: if you are running this on a school device, the chances are that you will be unable to install VPN applications, making this whole method useless. It also requires that you either find a good free VPN application or have a subscription to one. Download your preferred VPN application for your device, open the application, and enable it.

## None of these methods worked

If none of these methods worked for you, you are unfortunately out of luck. There is no possible way to bypass every individual blocking system, and therefore, I attempt to generalize these instuctions to work in as many places as possible. My only other suggestion would be to use a device connected to a non-school network such as cellular data or use a device that is connected to a non-school network as a personal hotspot. Other unblocking method may exist, but they are outside the scope of this tutorial.
